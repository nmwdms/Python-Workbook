       Now in China the problem of NEET has been brought into public attention.NEET refers to the group of people who are not currently engaged in education，employment or training，instead they just stay at home，relying on their parents.
　　There are mainly two reasons for this phenomenon.For one thing， since the expansion of university enrollment in l999，an increasing number of college graduates have poured into the job—hunting market.However， some of them are not fully prepared and become unemployed.For another， some young people are the only child of their family and badly spoilt.As a result，they are psychologically dependent even when they grow up.
　　To solve this problem，first.colleges or the communities should provide pre-job training courses for the young.Second，parents should cultivate their children's sense of independence in their childhood.Last but not least，college students also have to equip themselves with skills and knowledge and get ready to compete tomorrow.
